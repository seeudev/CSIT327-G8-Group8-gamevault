npm start
```

**Expected output:**
```
Compiled successfully!
You can now view gamevault_frontend in the browser.
  Local:            http://localhost:3000
```

## üß™ Testing the Application

### Option 1: Using the Web Interface

1. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:3000`

2. **Test Registration:**
   - Click "Sign up" link
   - Fill in the registration form:
     ```
     Username: testuser
     Email: test@gamevault.com
     Password: Test1234

     Username: admin
     Password: admin123
     ```
   - You should see the home page with admin role

### Option 2: Using API Calls

**Register a new user:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/register/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "username": "apiuser",
    "email": "api@gamevault.com",
    "password": "ApiPass123",
    "password_confirm": "ApiPass123"
  }'
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "message": "User registered successfully",
  "user": {
    "id": 2,
    "username": "apiuser",
    "email": "api@gamevault.com",
    ...
  },
  "tokens": {
    "access": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc...",
    "refresh": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGc..."
  }
}
```

**Login:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login/ \

## üêõ Common Issues

**Issue: Backend won't start**
- Solution: Make sure virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed
- Check: `pip list` should show Django, djangorestframework, etc.

**Issue: Frontend won't start**
- Solution: Delete `node_modules` and run `npm install` again
- Check: Node version with `node -v` (should be 16+)

**Issue: CORS errors in browser console**
- Solution: Ensure backend is running and CORS is configured for localhost:3000
- Check: `gamevault_backend/gamevault_backend/settings.py` CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS

**Issue: Database errors**
- Solution: Run migrations again
  ```bash
  python manage.py migrate
  python manage.py seed_database
  ```

**Issue: Can't login with admin credentials**
- Solution: Re-run the seeding command
  ```bash
  python manage.py seed_database
  ```

## üìä Database Info

The database has been seeded with:

**Roles:**
1. Administrator - Full system access
2. Buyer - Standard user access
3. Moderator - Limited admin access

**Default Admin User:**
- Username: `admin`
- Email: `admin@gamevault.com`
- Password: `admin123`
- Role: Administrator

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** Change the admin password after first login!
